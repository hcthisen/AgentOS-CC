### Data Flow Summary (One Sentence)

User messages arrive via Telegram, Claude Code processes them on the VPS, session data flows into local JSONL files, cron scripts extract/sync/summarize that data into Supabase (running on the same VPS), and the dashboard (proxied by Caddy on a subdomain) reads Supabase via localhost to display security and health metrics.

### Zero API Keys for Core Functionality

This system requires **ZERO API keys** for core functionality. Session summaries are generated via `claude -p --model haiku`, which uses the Claude Code CLI subscription — no Anthropic API key, no per-call billing, no credential file needed. The only external credentials required are Supabase connection details (auto-generated and self-hosted) and an optional Telegram bot token.

---

## 2. System Components

### 2.1 Claude Code CLI (Core Engine)

**What:** Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, running in a tmux session with the Telegram plugin.

**Why it exists:** Provides a stateful, always-running Claude instance that can be accessed from a phone via Telegram. The `--continue` flag resumes the last conversation, maintaining context across crashes and restarts.

**Key flags:**
- `--continue` — resume last session instead of starting fresh
- `--channels plugin:telegram@claude-plugins-official` — enable Telegram input/output

### 2.2 Memory System (memory.sh)

**What:** A bash script wrapping Supabase REST API calls that provides CRUD operations for memories, sessions, projects, and user profile data.

**Why it exists:** Claude Code has no built-in persistent memory across sessions. This script gives Claude a searchable, structured memory that survives restarts, crashes, and even server migrations.

**Key operations:**
- `load` — fetches recent memories, sessions, projects, and user profile at session start
- `search` / `deep-search` / `full-search` — three tiers of increasing search depth
- `add-memory` / `add-project` / `add-profile` — structured data entry
- `save-session` — manual session save (now largely replaced by automatic sync)

**Why 3-tier search:** Searching full session logs is slow and expensive. Quick summaries (tier 1) are loaded by default; detail summaries (tier 2) are searched on demand; full content (tier 3) is a last resort. This keeps the SessionStart hook fast while still making everything findable.

### 2.3 Session Sync (sync-sessions.sh)

**What:** Reads Claude Code's native `.jsonl` session files, extracts human-readable content (user + assistant messages only), and upserts into Supabase.

**Why it exists:** Claude Code stores sessions as JSONL files with a lot of internal metadata (tool calls, system prompts, binary data). This script extracts only the meaningful conversation text, making it searchable and summarizable.

**Key design choices:**
- Truncates individual messages to 500 characters (prevents bloat from large code dumps)
- Filters out `<system-reminder>` blocks (no sensitive context leaks)
- Default mode syncs only the most recently modified file (fast); `--all` syncs everything (initial setup)

### 2.4 Summary Generator (daily-summary.sh)

**What:** Finds sessions with content but no summary, checks that they have been inactive for 2+ hours, and uses `claude -p --model haiku` (Claude Code CLI subscription, no API key needed) to generate structured JSON summaries.

**Why it exists:** Raw session content is too long to load at session start. AI-generated summaries create a searchable index of all past work with key decisions, problems, and outcomes preserved.

**Key design choices:**
- Uses `claude -p --model haiku` via CLI subscription (fast, no per-call cost, sufficient quality for summaries)
- 2-hour inactivity threshold prevents summarizing sessions that are still in progress
- Content truncated to 80k chars (40k head + 40k tail) to fit Haiku's context window
- Generates both `summary` (2-3 sentences) and `detail_summary` (10-15 lines) for the two search tiers
- Regex fallback for JSON parsing (handles cases where Haiku wraps JSON in markdown)

### 2.5 Watchdog (watchdog.sh)

**What:** Checks every 5 minutes if Claude Code is running inside the tmux session. If not, restarts it.

**Why it exists:** Claude Code can crash, timeout, or exit after long idle periods. The watchdog ensures it is always available for Telegram messages.

**Process detection logic:**
1. Check if tmux session "claude" exists; if not, create it
2. Get the pane PID from tmux
3. Check direct children for a "claude" process
4. If not found, check grandchildren (shell -> claude)
5. If still not found, send the start command to the tmux pane

### 2.6 Security Sync (security-sync.sh)

**What:** Collects fail2ban bans (with GeoIP lookup), login history (via `last`), and aggregate stats, then pushes everything to Supabase.

**Why it exists:** Feeds the security dashboard with real-time ban/login data. Also provides historical tracking of attack patterns.

**Key design choices:**
- GeoIP via free ip-api.com (45 req/min limit, sufficient for ban-rate)
- Login history uses delete-all-then-reinsert strategy (simpler than upsert with timestamp keys)
- Includes tmux sessions in login data (labeled as "tmux (Claude Code)" for dashboard visibility)

### 2.7 Server Health (server-health.sh)

**What:** Collects comprehensive server metrics (CPU, RAM, disk, load, Docker containers, service statuses, open ports, attack data, Claude Code status) and pushes to Supabase as a single row.

**Why it exists:** Powers the server health section of the dashboard. Also calls `system-overview.sh` to capture the full system inventory.

**Metrics collected:**
- Hardware: CPU%, RAM, disk, load average
- Network: active connections, open ports with process names
- Services: Caddy, fail2ban, docker, ssh, Supabase reachability
- Claude: process running, Telegram plugin active, tmux session, last activity, total sessions
- Security: top attackers (from fail2ban log), failed logins per day (last 7 days)
- Cronjob health: last log entry from each cron script

### 2.8 System Overview (system-overview.sh)

**What:** Inventories all skills, credentials, scripts, cronjobs, logs, projects, and git repos, then stores the result as a JSON blob in `cc_server_health.system_overview`.

**Why it exists:** Gives the dashboard a complete picture of the Claude Code installation without needing SSH access.

### 2.9 Security Dashboard (Next.js on VPS)

**What:** A password-protected web dashboard displaying security events, server health, Claude Code status, and attack analytics. Runs as a Node.js process on the VPS, served via Caddy on `dashboard.domain.com`.

**Why it exists:** Provides a visual overview of the entire system without needing SSH access. Accessible from a phone browser.

**Architecture:**
- `app/page.js` — single-page React app with login screen and dashboard
- `app/api/auth/route.js` — password login, sets httpOnly cookie (7-day expiry)
- `app/api/auth/check/route.js` — session validation endpoint
- `app/api/security/route.js` — fetches all data from Supabase via localhost, returns aggregated JSON

### 2.10 Caddy (Reverse Proxy + Auto TLS)

**What:** Caddy serves as the reverse proxy for all web-facing services, automatically provisioning and renewing TLS certificates via Let's Encrypt.

**Why it exists:** With the domain and wildcard (`*.domain.com`) pointed at the VPS, Caddy routes subdomains to the correct internal services and handles HTTPS without manual certificate management.

**Routing:**
- `dashboard.domain.com` → Next.js dashboard (`:3000`)
- Additional subdomains can be added for future services

## 4. Decision Log

### 4.1 Why Supabase for Memory (Not Local Files)

**Problem:** Claude Code sessions are ephemeral. Local files can be lost, are not searchable with SQL, and cannot be accessed from a dashboard.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Local JSON/SQLite files: no remote access, no dashboard integration, fragile on disk failure
- PostgreSQL directly: no REST API, need custom API server, more ops overhead
- Firebase/Firestore: vendor lock-in, no self-hosting option

**Decision:** Self-hosted Supabase provides:
- PostgreSQL with a REST API (PostgREST) out of the box
- No additional API server needed — bash scripts talk directly to REST endpoints
- Row Level Security available if needed
- Self-hosted = full data control, no vendor dependency
- Free (runs on the same VPS infrastructure)

### 4.2 Why tmux + Watchdog (Not systemd)

**Problem:** Claude Code needs to stay running 24/7, but it is an interactive CLI that expects a terminal.

**Alternatives considered:**
- systemd service: Claude Code is interactive, needs a PTY; systemd services run headless. Attaching to debug is awkward. Restart logic is less flexible.
- screen: functionally equivalent to tmux but less widely used
- Docker container: overkill for a single CLI process; complicates Telegram plugin access

**Decision:** tmux + cron watchdog because:
- tmux provides a real terminal (Claude Code needs it)
- `tmux attach` gives instant debugging access
- Watchdog via cron is simple, stateless, and self-healing
- `--continue` flag means Claude resumes its last session automatically
- No PID files, no socket files, no service manager complexity

### 4.3 Why Haiku for Summaries (Not Opus)

**Problem:** Sessions need to be summarized into searchable metadata. This runs automatically every 2 hours.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Opus/Sonnet: higher quality but 10-50x the cost; summary quality from Haiku is sufficient for search keywords and brief overviews
- Local LLM: not available on this VPS; would need GPU
- No summaries (search raw content): too slow, too much noise

**Decision:** Haiku via `claude -p --model haiku` (Claude Code CLI) because:
- Cost: included in Claude Code subscription (no per-call API charges)
- Speed: fast enough to summarize 10+ sessions in one cron run
- Quality: sufficient for generating keywords, tags, and structured summaries
- No API key needed: uses the same Claude Code CLI subscription already installed on the VPS

### 4.4 Why JSONL Sync (Not Manual Save)

**Problem:** Earlier versions required Claude to manually run `save-session` at the end of each session. This was unreliable — sessions were lost when Claude crashed, timed out, or the user simply disconnected.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Manual save-session: relies on Claude remembering to save; fails on crashes
- Hook on session end: Claude Code has no reliable "session end" hook
- Real-time streaming to Supabase: too complex, too many writes

**Decision:** Cron-based JSONL sync because:
- Claude Code already writes `.jsonl` files natively — no custom logging needed
- Syncing every 30 minutes means at most 30 minutes of data loss on crash
- The sync script is idempotent (upsert logic) — safe to re-run
- Decouples data capture from data storage (Claude does not need to know about Supabase)

### 4.5 Why Caddy (Not nginx)

**Problem:** The VPS needs a reverse proxy to route subdomains to internal services and terminate TLS.

**Alternatives considered:**
- nginx: manual certificate management (certbot cron, renewal hooks), verbose config syntax, more moving parts
- Traefik: Docker-native but complex label-based config, overkill for a handful of services
- No reverse proxy (expose services directly): no TLS, no subdomain routing

**Decision:** Caddy because:
- Automatic HTTPS — provisions and renews Let's Encrypt certificates with zero configuration
- Simple Caddyfile syntax — a few lines per service vs. nginx's verbose server blocks
- Wildcard support — with DNS already pointed, adding new subdomains is trivial
- Single binary — no dependencies, no modules to compile

### 4.6 Why Dashboard on VPS (Not Vercel or External Hosting)

**Problem:** The dashboard needs to display data from Supabase. It could be hosted externally (Vercel, Netlify) or locally on the VPS.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Vercel: adds external dependency, requires exposing Supabase to the internet, credentials in third-party env vars
- Netlify/Cloudflare Pages: same exposure issues as Vercel
- Static site + client-side Supabase SDK: exposes database endpoint and keys in the browser

**Decision:** Next.js on VPS behind Caddy because:
- Supabase never needs to be exposed to the internet — dashboard connects via localhost
- All credentials stay on the VPS — no third-party env var stores
- Caddy handles TLS automatically on `dashboard.domain.com`
- One fewer external dependency — everything runs on the same machine
- Server-side API routes aggregate Supabase queries and enforce auth before any data fetch

### 4.7 Why Password Auth on Dashboard (Not OAuth)

**Problem:** The dashboard shows sensitive server data and needs access control.

**Alternatives considered:**
- NextAuth.js + OAuth: complex setup for a single user; needs OAuth provider or database
- Supabase Auth: adds another auth layer, more moving parts
- HTTP Basic Auth: not user-friendly on mobile

**Decision:** Simple password hash + httpOnly cookie because:
- Single-user system — one password is sufficient
- Password hash stored in environment variable on VPS (never in code)
- Session token is a SHA-256 hash, stored in httpOnly + secure + sameSite=strict cookie
- 7-day expiry — practical for daily mobile use
- Zero external dependencies
- Total implementation: ~30 lines of code

### 4.8 Why Single Bootstrap Script (Not Manual Multi-Phase Setup)

**Problem:** The system has many components (Docker, Supabase, scripts, crons, Caddy, dashboard) that must be configured in the right order with correct credentials.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Manual step-by-step guide: error-prone, tedious, hard to reproduce
- Ansible/Terraform: heavy tooling for a single-server setup
- Docker-only (everything in compose): Claude Code needs an interactive terminal, doesn't fit the container model

**Decision:** Single `bootstrap.sh` script with guided prompts because:
- One command to deploy the entire system
- Interactive prompts collect required config (domain, credentials, Telegram token)
- Can also run fully automated via environment variables (no prompts)
- Generates secrets automatically (Postgres password, JWT, Supabase keys)
- Idempotent — safe to re-run (updates existing installation)
- Creates systemd service for auto-start on reboot

## 5. Security Architecture

### Layer 1: Brute-Force Protection (fail2ban)

```
SSH connection attempt
    |
    v
fail2ban monitors /var/log/auth.log
    |
    +-- 5 failed attempts --> BAN IP for 10 minutes
    |
    +-- Repeated bans --> Longer ban durations
```

- **Tool:** fail2ban with `sshd` jail
- **Purpose:** Prevents SSH brute-force attacks by banning IPs after repeated failures
- **Integration:** Banned IPs synced to Supabase with GeoIP data every 10 minutes

**Note:** Network-level firewall rules (port filtering, etc.) are managed by the VPS hosting provider's firewall service, not by the VPS itself.

### Layer 2: Application Security (Dashboard)

```
Browser request to dashboard.domain.com
    |
    v
Caddy (TLS termination)
    |
    v
Next.js /api/auth/check — is dashboard_session cookie valid?
    |
    +-- NO  --> Show login screen
    +-- YES --> /api/security fetches data from Supabase (localhost)
                |
                v
                JSON response to browser
```

- **Auth:** SHA-256 password hash comparison
- **Session:** httpOnly, secure, sameSite=strict cookie
- **Supabase:** only accessible via localhost — never exposed to the internet
- **API routes:** validate session cookie before every data fetch

### Layer 3: Credential Isolation

```
~/.claude/credentials/     (chmod 600, root only)
    |
    +-- supabase.env        — SUPABASE_URL, keys

Dashboard environment:
    |
    +-- SUPABASE_URL         (localhost)
    +-- SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
    +-- DASHBOARD_PASSWORD_HASH
```

- Credentials are sourced by scripts, never printed or logged
- CLAUDE.md explicitly instructs: "Never share credentials over Telegram"
- No credentials are committed to git
- Supabase is only accessible via localhost — no external exposure

## 6. Automation Matrix

| Schedule      | Script              | Purpose                                           | Dependencies                        | Log File                  |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `*/5 * * * *` | `watchdog.sh`       | Ensure Claude Code is running in tmux             | tmux, claude CLI                    | `~/.claude/logs/watchdog.log` |
| `*/10 * * * *`| `security-sync.sh`  | Sync fail2ban bans + login history to Supabase    | fail2ban, supabase.env, python3     | `~/.claude/logs/security.log` |
| `*/10 * * * *`| `server-health.sh`  | Collect server metrics, push to Supabase          | supabase.env, python3, docker       | (stdout only)             |
| `*/30 * * * *`| `sync-sessions.sh`  | Sync active JSONL session content to Supabase     | supabase.env, python3, .jsonl files | `~/.claude/logs/sync.log` |
| `0 */2 * * *` | `daily-summary.sh`  | Generate Haiku summaries for inactive sessions    | claude CLI, supabase.env, python3   | `~/.claude/logs/summary-YYYY-MM-DD.log` |

**Implicit automation:**
- `system-overview.sh` is called by `server-health.sh` (not scheduled separately)
- `memory-load.sh` is triggered by Claude Code's SessionStart hook (not a cronjob)

## 8. Credential Management

### Where Secrets Live

| Secret                        | Location                                    | Used By                          |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `SUPABASE_URL`                | `~/.claude/credentials/supabase.env`        | All sync scripts, memory.sh      |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`   | `~/.claude/credentials/supabase.env`        | All sync scripts (full DB access)|
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`           | `~/.claude/credentials/supabase.env`        | Dashboard API route (read-only)  |
| `JWT_SECRET`                  | `/opt/agentos/.env` (auto-generated)        | Supabase internal auth           |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`           | `/opt/agentos/.env` (auto-generated)        | Supabase internal                |
| `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD_HASH`     | `/opt/agentos/.env`                         | Dashboard auth                   |

### Access Patterns

- **VPS scripts** use `source ~/.claude/credentials/supabase.env`. This loads `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` as shell variables.
- **Dashboard** uses `process.env.*` in Next.js API routes. Supabase keys are loaded from `/opt/agentos/.env` and are never bundled into client-side JavaScript.
- **Summaries** are generated via `claude -p --model haiku` using the Claude Code CLI subscription — no API key file needed.
- **Auto-generated secrets** (Postgres password, JWT secret, Supabase keys) are created by the bootstrap script and stored in `/opt/agentos/.env`.

### Security Rules

1. All credential files are `chmod 600` (root read/write only)
2. CLAUDE.md explicitly forbids sharing credentials over Telegram
3. The dashboard uses `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (not service role key) — limited to read access via RLS
4. No credentials are committed to git
5. Supabase is only accessible via localhost — never exposed externally

---

## 9. Failure Modes & Recovery

### 9.1 Claude Code Crashes / Exits

| What happens | Detection | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Claude CLI process dies | watchdog.sh (cron, every 5 min) | Sends `claude --continue` to tmux pane |
| tmux session dies entirely | watchdog.sh detects missing session | Creates new tmux session with Claude command |
| Claude enters error loop | Manual observation via `tmux attach` | Kill process, watchdog restarts in 5 min |

**Data loss:** None. JSONL files are written by Claude Code in real-time. Last sync to Supabase is at most 30 minutes old.

### 9.2 Supabase Unreachable

| What happens | Detection | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Supabase container goes down | server-health.sh marks "unreachable" | Docker auto-restarts container; sync scripts retry on next cycle |
| Database full | API returns 500 errors | Manual cleanup of old sessions |

**Data loss:** JSONL files remain on local disk. Once Supabase recovers, run `sync-sessions.sh --all` to backfill. Summaries will be generated on next `daily-summary.sh` run.

**Impact on Claude:** Claude Code continues working normally. SessionStart hook will fail to load memories (Claude starts without context). Memory search commands will return errors.

### 9.3 VPS Reboots

| Component | Auto-recovery |
|---|---|
| tmux + Claude Code | watchdog.sh cron (within 5 min of cron starting) |
| Cronjobs | crontab survives reboot |
| fail2ban | systemd auto-start |
| Docker (Supabase + Dashboard) | systemd auto-start (restart: always) |
| Caddy | systemd auto-start |

### 9.4 Summary Generation Fails (claude -p)

| What happens | Detection | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Claude CLI not authenticated | daily-summary.sh logs error | Re-authenticate Claude Code CLI on the VPS |
| Rate limit / subscription issue | daily-summary.sh logs error | Check Claude Code subscription status; automatic retry on next 2h cycle |

**Impact:** Summaries stop being generated. Session content is still synced. Search tier 1 (summaries) returns nothing new; tiers 2-3 still work on existing data.

### 9.5 Dashboard Auth Compromised

| What happens | Detection | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Password leaked | Unauthorized access observed | Update `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD_HASH` in `/opt/agentos/.env`; restart dashboard |

**Impact limited to:** Read-only view of security data. Dashboard has no write access to Supabase (uses anon key). No server control possible through the dashboard.

### 9.6 Disk Full on VPS

| What happens | Detection | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| JSONL files fill disk | server-health.sh reports disk_used approaching disk_total | Delete old .jsonl files (already synced to Supabase) |
| Logs fill disk | Checking log file sizes | Rotate logs; summary logs already date-stamped |
| Docker volumes fill disk | `docker system df` | Prune unused images/volumes |

**Prevention:** Monitor disk via dashboard. JSONL files can safely be deleted after sync + summarization.

---

## 10. Setup Order (Fresh Install)

The entire system is deployable in a single session via a bootstrap script with guided prompts. The user needs only a VPS with SSH access and a domain pointed at it.

### Prerequisites

Before running the installer:

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| VPS | Any Linux VPS with root access (Ubuntu 22.04+ recommended) |
| Domain DNS | `domain.com` A record → VPS IP |
| Wildcard DNS | `*.domain.com` A record → VPS IP |
| Claude Code CLI | Authenticated Claude Code subscription (provides `claude -p` for summaries) |

### Bootstrap Installation

**Interactive install (guided prompts):**

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<repo>/main/bootstrap.sh)"
```

**Fully automated (no prompts):**

```bash
AGENTOS_DOMAIN=example.com \
AGENTOS_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD=supersecretpassword \
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456:ABC-DEF... \
  bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<repo>/main/bootstrap.sh)"
```

### What the Bootstrap Script Does

```
Phase 1: System Dependencies
  1. Install Docker + Docker Compose (if missing)
  2. Install tmux, fail2ban, python3, curl, jq
  3. Clone/update the repo to /opt/agentos

Phase 2: Configuration
  4. Prompt for domain (or read AGENTOS_DOMAIN env var)
  5. Prompt for dashboard password (or read env var)
  6. Prompt for Telegram bot token (optional, or read env var)
  7. Auto-generate secrets: Postgres password, JWT secret, Supabase anon/service keys

Phase 3: Supabase + Database
  9. Write /opt/agentos/.env with all config
  10. Start Supabase via Docker Compose
  11. Run SQL migrations to create all tables:
      cc_sessions, cc_memory, cc_projects, cc_user_profile,
      cc_security_bans, cc_security_logins, cc_security_stats, cc_server_health

Phase 4: Dashboard + Caddy
  12. Build/start the Next.js dashboard container
  13. Write Caddyfile with subdomain routing
  14. Start/reload Caddy (auto-provisions TLS certificates)

Phase 5: Claude Code + Scripts
  15. Deploy scripts to /opt/agentos/scripts/
  16. Create ~/.claude/credentials/ with supabase.env
  17. Configure Claude Code SessionStart hook in ~/.claude/settings.json
  18. Install cronjobs (watchdog, security-sync, health, session-sync, summary)
  19. Install Claude Code CLI (if missing)

Phase 6: Telegram + Launch
  20. Start tmux session with Claude Code + Telegram plugin
  21. Run initial data sync (security, health, sessions)

Phase 7: Verification
  22. Verify Supabase is reachable
  23. Verify dashboard loads at https://dashboard.domain.com
  24. Verify Claude Code is running in tmux
  25. Print summary with access details
```

### Environment Variables (Bootstrap)

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `AGENTOS_DOMAIN` | Yes* | Root domain pointed at the VPS |
| `AGENTOS_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` | Yes* | Dashboard login password |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | No* | Telegram bot token (from @BotFather) |
| `AGENTOS_DIR` | No | Install directory (default: `/opt/agentos`) |

\* Prompted interactively if not set as environment variable.

### Auto-Generated Secrets

On first run, the bootstrap script generates and stores in `/opt/agentos/.env`:

- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
- `JWT_SECRET`
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD_HASH` (SHA-256 of the provided password)

These are never manually managed. Re-running the bootstrap preserves existing secrets.

### Post-Install Operations

```bash
cd /opt/agentos

# Check system status
bash scripts/status.sh

# View logs
tail -f logs/watchdog.log
tail -f logs/security.log

# Attach to Claude Code session
tmux attach -t claude

# Restart services
docker compose restart

# Update installation
git pull && bash bootstrap.sh
```

### Dependency Graph

```
Prerequisites (VPS + DNS + Claude Code CLI subscription)
  |
  +-- Phase 1 (System deps: Docker, tmux, fail2ban)
        |
        +-- Phase 2 (Collect config / read env vars)
              |
              +-- Phase 3 (Supabase + DB tables)
              |     |
              |     +-- Phase 4 (Dashboard + Caddy)
              |     |
              |     +-- Phase 5 (Claude Code + scripts + crons)
              |           |
              |           +-- Phase 6 (Telegram + launch)
              |                 |
              |                 +-- Phase 7 (Verification)
```
